# personal-website
first version of personal website created in rithm pre-work

In this first draft of a portfolio website built in HTML and CSS, I created a non-responsive outline for a multi-page site 
with a landing page, about page, portfolio page, and contact page. Links connect to my blog, linkedin, github, and a pdf version
of my resume/cv. 

Next steps: Figure out how to use responsive layouts so that certain elements can by grouped and also I can deploy a responsive
version of this site. 

This was my first time building anything! For when I'm feeling way more comfortable with CSS layouts, it's good to remember a 
time when it took me forever to make this :).
